### Welcome to DOT demo evening on Saturday 16.9.2023 at OUBS Studio!

This is a good opportunity for new members and those interested in DOT to learn
more about our club and demoscene.

During the event we will watch various demoscene productions from over the years.

The event also serves as a hackathon, you can try to make your own demo during
the event and we will have a small demo compo in the evening.

You are not required to participate in the Hackathon, you can just come and watch demos,
hang out and get to know our club!
