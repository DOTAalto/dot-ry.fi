### Welcome to DOT demo-making day on Saturday 21.10.2023 at Aalto Design Factory

Join us for another day of making and watching [demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)! This time, the theme is [fantasy consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console), which are artificially limited virtual computers aiming to make graphics and audio programming simple and fun. Check out the [TIC-80 example page](http://tic80.com/play?cat=5) to get an idea of what these computers are capable of.

We are also visiting Ryoji Ikeda’s exhibition in Amos Rex at 18:00 on the Friday before – to maximize inspiration. This is completely optional but a highly recommended exhibition. See [the event page](/news/ikeda-20.10.2023/) for more info.

### For who?
Anyone interested in computational art. Basic programming skills are recommended, but you can also team up with someone and ask for parameters to explore. We are aiming to make our events as beginner friendly as possible, but as the theme *fantasy computers* is a bit more technical one, this event might not be the absolutely most approachable with a purely visual or musical background. However, in a sense we are all beginners, so if *fantasy computers* sounds like fun, you are very welcome to join us! :)

### Platforms

- [TIC-80](https://tic80.com) – recommended
    <details><summary>Some helpful links</summary>
    - [TIC-80 documentation](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki)
    - [Lua reference](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/) if you're using lua (the default scripting language), especially the list of functions at the end
    - Advanced: To make 3D things, see the [ttri function](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/ttri) and [this snippet](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Code-examples-and-snippets#ttri-xyz-rotation)
</details>
- [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) – if you don’t mind the paywall
- [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org/) – for web hipsters
- [Uxn+Varvava](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) – if you are feeling hardcore.
    <details><summary>Some helpful links</summary>
    - [Compudanzas Uxn tutorial](https://compudanzas.net/uxn_tutorial.html) - This is intended to be completed in seven days, so might be a bit tight to do in one day. We warned you it's hardcore!
    - [Uxntal on XXIIVV wiki](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html)
    - [Varvara device reference](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html) - drawing, audio, etc.
    - [Uxntal opcode reference](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal_reference.html)
</details>

If you have another similar platform in mind that you would like to make a demo with, feel free to ask us. However, our aim is to keep organizing fairly stream-lined.

### Timetable
- 10:00 event starts – for the early birds
- **12:00 opening keynote, inspiration**
- 13:30–15:00 recommended lunch window
- 18:30 submission deadline
- **19:00 demo compo**
- 20:00 networking / discussions
- 22:00 event ends

Like last time, you may attend the whole event, just the demo compo, or something in between. If you want to make a demo, or if you are new, we recommend coming to the keynote.

### Location
Aalto Design Factory

Puumiehenkuja 5A, 02150 Espoo

### Remote participation
Our big picture goal is to learn how to organize remote participation smoothly, but depending on organizer resources, we might do or skip this.

### After the event
Recordings of the demos will be published on [DOT’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDOTry), like [last time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv6Z9RkWEK4&list=PLmRDkQf8W1WEaT5I-F3BpZ46czsg0L_sY).
