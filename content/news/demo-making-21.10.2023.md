### Welcome to DOT demo-making day on Saturday 21.10.2023 at Aalto Design Factory

This is continuation of the demo evenings started on 16.9. – this time, the theme is fantasy computers!

We are also visiting [Ryoji Ikeda’s exhibition](https://amosrex.fi/en/exhibitions/ryoji-ikeda/) in Amos Rex at 18:00 on the Friday before – to maximize inspiration. This is completely optional but a highly recommended exhibition.

### Platforms
- [TIC-80](https://tic80.com) – recommended
- [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) – if you don’t mind the paywall
- [UXN+Varvava](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) – if you are feeling hardcore.

Other platforms are not supported in order to keep organizing streamlined, and to provoke creativity.

### Timetable
- 10:00 event starts (for the early birds)
- **12:00 opening keynote, inspiration**
- 13:30–15:00 recommended lunch window
- 18:30 submission deadline
- **19:00 demo compo**
- 20:00 networking / discussions
- 22:00 event ends

Like last time, you may attend the whole event, just the demo compo, or something in between. If you want to make a demo, we recommend arriving before the keynote.

### Location
Aalto Design Factory

Puumiehenkuja 5A, 02150 Espoo

### Remote participation
Our big picture goal is to learn how to organize remote participation smoothly, but depending on how other areas progress, we might add or skip this, or do something that requires very little organizing effort.

### After the event
Recordings of the demos will be published on [DOT’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDOTry), like [last time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv6Z9RkWEK4&list=PLmRDkQf8W1WEaT5I-F3BpZ46czsg0L_sY).
