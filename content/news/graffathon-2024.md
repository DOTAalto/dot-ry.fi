Welcome to Graffathon! 

Graffathon is a weekend-long demoscene / computer art hackathon. Newbies and veterans alike create real-time audiovisual art in small teams or individually. As a total beginner you can get a headstart with our tutorial, as long as you are excited about computational art! The artworks are presented on the big screen on Sunday. See specific schedule on Eventbrite.
